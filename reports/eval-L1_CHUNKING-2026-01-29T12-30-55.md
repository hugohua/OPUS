# Evaluation Report: L1_CHUNKING
**Date**: 2026/1/29 20:30:55
**Total Comparison**: 5 Cases

## 💡 Optimization Suggestions
- [l1_chunk_001] **qwen-flash**: Rewrite the sentence to mimic a realistic business email (e.g., 'The manager has approved the budget for Q3 marketing initiatives, effective immediately.'). Use only naturally occurring semantic chunks as options. Ensure all text is in English. Replace the explanation with a clear, concise rationale in English. Align the task type with actual TOEIC listening patterns—focus on identifying key information, not artificial chunking.
- [l1_chunk_002] **qwen-flash**: Revise the sentence to reflect more natural business communication (e.g., 'We delivered the draft on schedule, but the client has asked for additional revisions'). Redesign distractors to be plausible but clearly incorrect (e.g., 'on schedule', 'further revisions' instead of 'further changes'). Ensure explanations are in clear, concise English. Avoid mixing languages in explanations. Prioritize authentic workplace phrasing over syntactic perfection.
- [l1_chunk_003] **qwen-flash**: Rewrite the source sentence to reflect authentic business communication style (e.g., concise, formal, with natural clause integration). Ensure chunking reflects actual syntactic units (e.g., 'expressed concerns regarding...' as one chunk). Use realistic distractors that mimic common misinterpretations by learners. Replace non-English explanations with clear, native-level English justifications focused on meaning and grammar in context.
- [l1_chunk_004] **qwen-flash**: Revise the source sentence to use natural, authentic business language. Replace 'recently implementation' with 'recent implementation' or rephrase entirely. Ensure all distractors are plausible, grammatically correct phrases that could reasonably be misidentified by learners—e.g., 'of the new software policy' vs. 'software policy'—not outright errors. Focus on syntactic and semantic boundaries in real workplace communication.
- [l1_chunk_005] **qwen-flash**: Revise the system prompt to emphasize natural business email phrasing, avoid over-segmentation, use only English explanations, and ensure distractors reflect plausible but incorrect interpretations of real workplace communication. Prioritize authentic lexical collocations and syntactic patterns found in official TOEIC sample texts.

## Case: l1_chunk_001
> Short simple sentence

**Input**: `{"sentence":"The manager approved the budget.","targetWord":"approved"}`

| Dimension | Primary (qwen-flash) | Secondary (google/gemini-3-flash-preview) |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Judge Score** | 3/10 | - |
| **Reason** | The content fails multiple authenticity and pedagogical criteria. First, the sentence 'The manager approved the budget.' is overly simplistic and lacks natural business email tone—real TOEIC-style emails would include context like deadlines, approvals in a chain, or follow-up actions. Second, the distractors are poorly constructed: 'approved the' and 'budget.' are grammatically awkward and unnatural chunks; real learners wouldn't mistake these as valid units. Third, the correct answer 'The manager,approved the budget' uses a comma instead of proper spacing, which is misleading and unprofessional. The explanation '意群划分：主语 + 谓语短语' is in Chinese, which undermines the English language focus of TOEIC. Finally, the interaction format (bubble_select) with such trivial chunking does not reflect authentic TOEIC listening comprehension tasks, which prioritize understanding intent, tone, and implied meaning over mechanical parsing. | - |

## Case: l1_chunk_002
> Compound sentence with 'but'

**Input**: `{"sentence":"We finished the draft on time but the client requested further changes.","targetWord":"requested"}`

| Dimension | Primary (qwen-flash) | Secondary (google/gemini-3-flash-preview) |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Judge Score** | 4/10 | - |
| **Reason** | The content fails authenticity and naturalness criteria. The sentence 'We finished the draft on time but the client requested further changes' is overly simplistic and lacks the nuanced, contextually rich phrasing typical of real business emails. The distractors in the bubble select task are poorly constructed: 'draft on time' is grammatically incorrect as a chunk (should be 'the draft on time'), 'requested' alone is incomplete, and 'requested further' is not a valid semantic unit. Additionally, the explanation in Chinese ('意群划分：并列句结构，包含时间状语和完整谓语。') is inappropriate for an English TOEIC-style drill and undermines the authenticity of the exercise. The overall structure feels AI-generated due to rigid chunking and unnatural distractor design. | - |

## Case: l1_chunk_003
> Complex office scenario

**Input**: `{"sentence":"Although the presentation was successful, some board members expressed concerns regarding the proposed expansion strategy.","targetWord":"expressed"}`

| Dimension | Primary (qwen-flash) | Secondary (google/gemini-3-flash-preview) |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Judge Score** | 4/10 | - |
| **Reason** | The content fails authenticity and naturalness for a real business email context. The sentence structure is overly simplistic and artificially segmented, resembling a textbook exercise rather than genuine corporate communication. The phrase 'Although the presentation was successful' is not typical of how board-level discussions are reported in real memos—such nuance would be expressed more fluidly (e.g., 'While the presentation went well, several members raised concerns...'). Additionally, the distractors in the bubble select task are poorly constructed: 'was successful' and 'expressed' are isolated as single chunks, breaking grammatical cohesion (e.g., 'expressed concerns' should be treated as a unit). The answer key format is also unnatural—using commas to separate chunks instead of proper semantic grouping. The explanation is too technical and non-native in tone ('意群划分：让步状语 + 主句（主语+谓语+宾语）'), which feels AI-generated and inappropriate for TOEIC test design. Overall, the drill lacks realism, plausible distractors, and natural language flow. | - |

## Case: l1_chunk_004
> Sentence with multiple modifiers

**Input**: `{"sentence":"The recently implementation of the new software policy has significantly improved our team's productivity.","targetWord":"improved"}`

| Dimension | Primary (qwen-flash) | Secondary (google/gemini-3-flash-preview) |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Judge Score** | 3/10 | - |
| **Reason** | The content fails multiple authenticity and pedagogical criteria. First, the phrase 'recently implementation' is grammatically incorrect and unnatural—native speakers would say 'recent implementation' or 'implementation of the new software policy.' The error is not subtle; it's a glaring mistake that would not appear in real business communication. Second, the distractor 'The recently implementation' is poorly constructed: it's not just a semantic chunk but an outright grammatical error, making it implausible as a distractor in a real-world context. Third, the explanation mentions that this error is intentional for testing purposes, which undermines the realism of the scenario. Real TOEIC-style questions test natural usage, not artificial errors. Finally, the interaction design (bubble_select) with such a flawed sentence reduces credibility and risks confusing learners. The overall tone feels AI-generated and overly mechanical. | - |

## Case: l1_chunk_005
> Business email snippet

**Input**: `{"sentence":"Please let me know your availability for a brief meeting to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign next Tuesday.","targetWord":"discuss"}`

| Dimension | Primary (qwen-flash) | Secondary (google/gemini-3-flash-preview) |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Judge Score** | 4/10 | - |
| **Reason** | The content exhibits strong signs of AI generation: the segmentation into chunks is overly mechanical and unnatural for real business communication. In authentic TOEIC-style emails, native speakers do not typically break sentences into such rigid, grammatically isolated fragments (e.g., 'for a brief' or 'meeting to discuss' as separate units). The answer key treats 'for a brief meeting' as a single chunk, but the distractor 'for a brief' is illogical—no native speaker would split 'a brief meeting' like that in practice. Additionally, the explanation uses non-English terminology ('意群划分') and technical jargon ('动词不定式作目的状语') that would not appear in actual TOEIC test materials. These elements undermine context authenticity and make the item feel artificial. Distractors are implausible due to their unnatural phrasing, and the logic flow relies on internal grammar rules rather than real-world usage. | - |
