# Evaluation Report: L1_CHUNKING
**Date**: 2026/1/29 20:29:17
**Total Comparison**: 5 Cases

## 💡 Optimization Suggestions
- [l1_chunk_001] **qwen-flash**: Revise the system prompt to emphasize authenticity: generate only naturally occurring business emails/memos at Level 1 TOEIC proficiency. Ensure semantic chunking reflects real spoken or written business English (e.g., focus on meaningful phrases like 'approved the budget' or 'next quarter's forecast'), avoid unnatural splits, and use plausible distractors that reflect common misinterpretations by non-native speakers—not syntactic nonsense. Prioritize contextual relevance over mechanical parsing.
- [l1_chunk_002] **qwen-flash**: Rewrite the source sentence to reflect authentic business communication (e.g., 'We delivered the draft on schedule, though the client has requested additional revisions'). Ensure semantic chunks follow natural syntactic boundaries (e.g., noun phrases, verb phrases). Use only plausible distractors that mimic common real-world misperceptions (e.g., splitting 'on time' or combining 'requested further changes' incorrectly). Remove non-English explanations. Keep all content in natural, fluent English appropriate for Level 1 TOEIC learners.
- [l1_chunk_003] **qwen-flash**: Rewrite the drill using naturally occurring business language from real corporate emails. Use only complete, meaningful semantic chunks that reflect actual communication patterns (e.g., 'some board members expressed concerns' as one chunk). Ensure all options are grammatically coherent and contextually plausible. Replace non-English explanations with clear, concise English rationale. Avoid over-segmentation and ensure interaction design reflects real user behavior in digital assessments.
- [l1_chunk_004] **qwen-flash**: Revise the system prompt to prioritize grammatical accuracy and natural business language. Require that all example sentences follow standard English syntax, use only plausible semantic chunks, and avoid constructed errors. Ensure that distractors are realistic but incorrect (e.g., misaligned boundaries like 'recently implementation' vs. 'recent implementation') and that explanations clarify why certain chunks are wrong based on grammar, meaning, or cohesion—not fabricated rules.
- [l1_chunk_005] **qwen-flash**: Revise the system prompt to emphasize: (1) Use naturally occurring business language from real TOEIC-style emails; (2) Ensure chunking reflects actual syntactic and pragmatic groupings used by native speakers; (3) Make distractors plausible—e.g., include common misgroupings like 'next Tuesday' with 'campaign' or 'marketing campaign' split incorrectly—but still clearly wrong based on natural usage. Avoid robotic segmentation. Prioritize authenticity over pedagogical convenience.

## Case: l1_chunk_001
> Short simple sentence

**Input**: `{"sentence":"The manager approved the budget.","targetWord":"approved"}`

| Dimension | Primary (qwen-flash) | Secondary (google/gemini-3-flash-preview) |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Judge Score** | 3/10 | 0 |
| **Reason** | The content fails authenticity and naturalness criteria for a real business email context. The sentence 'The manager approved the budget.' is overly simplistic and lacks the nuance, tone, or structure typical of actual TOEIC-level business communication. Additionally, the distractors in the bubble select task are poorly designed: 'approved the' and 'budget.' are grammatically incomplete or malformed chunks, which would not appear in authentic workplace language. The explanation incorrectly frames 'approved the budget' as a single unit without acknowledging that in natural speech, 'the budget' may be treated as a separate semantic chunk depending on emphasis. Most critically, the interaction design feels artificial—real TOEIC tasks don't ask users to 'tap semantic chunks' in such a rigid, deconstructed way. This format reads clearly as AI-generated with no grounding in authentic business discourse. | Judge Failed |

## Case: l1_chunk_002
> Compound sentence with 'but'

**Input**: `{"sentence":"We finished the draft on time but the client requested further changes.","targetWord":"requested"}`

| Dimension | Primary (qwen-flash) | Secondary (google/gemini-3-flash-preview) |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Judge Score** | 4/10 | 0 |
| **Reason** | The content fails authenticity and naturalness in multiple ways. First, the sentence 'We finished the draft on time but the client requested further changes.' is grammatically correct but sounds overly simplistic and robotic for a real business email—native speakers would typically use more nuanced phrasing like 'We delivered the draft on schedule, though the client has asked for additional revisions.' Second, the chunking in the answer key is unnatural: 'the draft on' is not a valid semantic chunk (it's ungrammatical), and 'requested further' is incomplete. The correct chunks should be 'We finished the draft', 'on time', 'but the client', 'requested further changes'. Third, the explanation is in Chinese ('意群划分...'), which breaks context authenticity for an English-language TOEIC drill. Finally, the distractors are implausible—'the draft on' and 'requested further' don't sound like real language errors professionals would make. This feels clearly AI-generated due to rigid, incorrect segmentation and unnatural phrasing. | Judge Failed |

## Case: l1_chunk_003
> Complex office scenario

**Input**: `{"sentence":"Although the presentation was successful, some board members expressed concerns regarding the proposed expansion strategy.","targetWord":"expressed"}`

| Dimension | Primary (qwen-flash) | Secondary (google/gemini-3-flash-preview) |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Judge Score** | 4/10 | 0 |
| **Reason** | The content fails on multiple fronts for TOEIC-level authenticity and naturalness. First, the sentence structure is overly mechanical and artificial—'Although the presentation was successful' is a valid clause, but the chunking choices (e.g., 'was successful' as a standalone chunk) break natural reading flow. Real business emails don't emphasize such rigid syntactic segmentation. Second, the distractors like 'regarding the' are grammatically incomplete and would never appear as a standalone semantic unit in authentic business communication. Third, the explanation ('意群划分：让步状语 + 状语从句主干 + ...') is written in Chinese and inappropriate for an English-language TOEIC drill, indicating AI-generated content with poor localization. Finally, the answer key format uses commas to join chunks, which is unnatural and not how real users would select items in a bubble-select interface. This feels like a textbook exercise rather than a genuine business email. | Judge Failed |

## Case: l1_chunk_004
> Sentence with multiple modifiers

**Input**: `{"sentence":"The recently implementation of the new software policy has significantly improved our team's productivity.","targetWord":"improved"}`

| Dimension | Primary (qwen-flash) | Secondary (google/gemini-3-flash-preview) |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Judge Score** | 3/10 | 0 |
| **Reason** | The content fails multiple authenticity and logic criteria. First, 'The recently implementation' is grammatically incorrect—'recently' is an adverb, not an adjective, so it cannot modify 'implementation' as a noun phrase. The correct phrase should be 'the recent implementation.' This error makes the entire sentence unnatural and unprofessional, which would never appear in a real business email. Second, the distractor 'recently implementation' is illogical because it combines two words that cannot form a valid chunk; however, 'improved our team's' is also invalid as a standalone semantic chunk (it lacks a subject). Third, the explanation incorrectly labels 'The recently implementation' as a 'correct' main clause when it is actually a grammatical error. In authentic TOEIC-style content, such errors would not occur. The distractors are implausible or nonsensical, undermining their quality. Overall, this drill feels AI-generated due to its syntactic flaws and artificial structure. | Judge Failed |

## Case: l1_chunk_005
> Business email snippet

**Input**: `{"sentence":"Please let me know your availability for a brief meeting to discuss the upcoming marketing campaign next Tuesday.","targetWord":"discuss"}`

| Dimension | Primary (qwen-flash) | Secondary (google/gemini-3-flash-preview) |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Judge Score** | 4/10 | 0 |
| **Reason** | The content fails authenticity and naturalness in business communication. The sentence structure is overly segmented and artificial, particularly in the 'interaction' task where chunks like 'for a brief', 'meeting to discuss', and 'campaign next Tuesday' are split unnaturally. In real business emails, native speakers would not break 'brief meeting' or 'discuss the upcoming marketing campaign' into separate chunks—these are fixed collocations. Additionally, the explanation mentions 'time phrase' as a category but doesn't reflect how native speakers actually parse such sentences. The distractors (incorrect options) are implausible because they’re clearly non-standard splits that wouldn’t appear in authentic usage. This makes the drill feel mechanical and AI-generated, lacking the subtle flow of real workplace communication. Furthermore, the phrasing 'Tap the semantic chunks' sounds like a UI prompt rather than a natural instruction in a business email context. | Judge Failed |
