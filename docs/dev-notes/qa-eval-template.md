# QA Evaluation Prompt Template

这是一个可以用于在其他对话框中评估 LLM 生成结果质量的 Prompt 模板。
设计思路：**通过角色扮演和详细的评估维度，让另一个 LLM 扮演“质检员”，对生成内容进行深度审计。**

---

## 使用说明

1. **复制** 下方的 Prompt 内容。
2. **替换** `{}` 中的内容：填入你实际使用的 System Prompt、User Input 和 AI 生成的 Result。
3. **发送** 给高级推理模型 (Claude 3.5 Sonnet / GPT-4o)。
4. **查看评分**：如果评分 < 8 或通过 Rule Compliance Check 失败，则需要优化 Prompt。

# QA Evaluation Prompt

Please act as a **Strict Data Auditor & Linguistic Expert**.
Your task is to evaluate the quality of the "Result" generated by an AI model, based on the specific "System Prompt" and "User Prompt" provided below.

---

## 1. Context (The Task)

### System Prompt (The Rules):
{
  # ROLE
  You are a Deterministic Data Transformation Engine used in an OFFLINE batch ETL pipeline.
  Your sole responsibility is to compute structured vocabulary metadata for "Opus", a TOEIC Workplace Simulator.
  
  # TASK
  Process the provided vocabulary list. For each word, generate metadata strictly adhering to the schema.
  
  # CRITICAL RULES (Excerpt):
  1. Priority: IF `def_jp` exists, translate THAT into Simplified Chinese. ELSE, translate `def_en`.
  2. definition_cn: MUST reflect the primary TOEIC business sense. Max 10 chars.
  3. word_family: If a form does not exist, return `null`. DO NOT invent words.
  4. confusing_words: Must be visually or auditorily confusable (Malapropisms). NO antonyms.
  5. synonyms: Must be formal business paraphrases. NO casual words.
}

### User Prompt (The Input):
{
  [
    { "word": "minute", "def_jp": "議事録", "col_jp": [...] },
    { "word": "competitive", "def_en": "as good as or better than others...", "col_jp": [] },
    { "word": "assess", "def_jp": "評価する" }
  ]
}

## 2. The Result to Evaluate (AI Output)

### Result:
{
  "items": [
    {
      "word": "minute",
      "definition_cn": "会议记录",
      "definitions": { "business_cn": "会议纪要", "general_cn": "分钟" },
      "priority": "CORE",
      "scenarios": ["office_admin", "management"],
      "collocations": [ { "text": "take the minutes", "trans": "做会议记录", "origin": "abceed" } ],
      "word_family": { "n": "minute", "v": null, "adj": "minute", "adv": null },
      "confusing_words": ["minuet", "minutia"],
      "synonyms": ["record", "proceedings"]
    },
    // ... (Your AI Output Here)
  ]
}

## 3. Evaluation Task (Your Job)

Please analyze the "Result" above and provide a structured report covering:

1.  **Rule Compliance Check**:
    * Did the AI output strict JSON without markdown or extra text?
    * Did it follow the translation priority (JP > EN)?
    * Did it respect the `null` rule for non-existent word forms?

2.  **Linguistic Quality Check**:
    * **Business Sense**: Is the `definition_cn` appropriate for a TOEIC context? (e.g., "minute" should be "会议记录", not "分钟").
    * **Word Family Accuracy**: Are the derived forms (n/v/adj/adv) grammatically correct?
    * **Distractor Quality**: Are `confusing_words` truly visually/auditorily similar (e.g. access/assess), or just random?
    * **Synonym Formality**: Are `synonyms` formal enough for business usage?

3.  **Optimization Feedback (CRITICAL)**:
    * If you found any issues, provide a specific **Suggestion** to improve the System Prompt.
    * Format: "Suggestion: Add rule 'X' to prevent 'Y'."

4.  **Overall Score**:
    * Give a score from 1-10.
    * State if this data is "Production Ready" or "Needs Revision".

**Output your analysis below:**
